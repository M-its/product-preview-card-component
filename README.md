## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project i was able to use media queries and a mobile-first workflow, besides praticing focus pseudo-element like this:

```css
button:hover {
    background-color: var(--Very-Dark-cyan);
    transition: background 0.3s ease-in-out;
    cursor: pointer;
}

button:focus {
    background-color: var(--Very-Dark-cyan);
}
```

### Continued development

I still need to pratice pseudo-elements.

### Useful resources
